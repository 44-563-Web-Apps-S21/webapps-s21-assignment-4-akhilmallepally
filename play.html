        <h3>Act 3, Scene 6: Camp before Florence

        <p class="stage-direction">   Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords </p>

        <h4 class="name">Second Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech second-lord"> Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
            way. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">First Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech first-lord"> If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
            more in your respect. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">Second Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech second-lord"> On my life, my lord, a bubble. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">BERTRAM</h4>
        
        <p class="speech BERTRAM"> Do you think I am so far deceived in him? </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">Second Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech second-lord"> Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
            without any malice, but to speak of him as my
            kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
            endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
            of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
            entertainment. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">First Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech first-lord"> It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
            his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
            great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.  </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">BERTRAM</h4>
        
        <p class="speech BERTRAM"> I would I knew in what particular action to try him. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">First Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech first-lord"> None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
            which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">Second Lord</h4>
        
        <p class="speech second-lord"> I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
            surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
            knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
            him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
            is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
            we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
            present at his examination: if he do not, for the
            promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
            base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
            intelligence in his power against you, and that with
            the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
            trust my judgment in any thing. </p>
        
        <h4 class="name">First Lord</h4>

        <p class="speech first-lord"> O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
            he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
            lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
            what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
            melted, if you give him not John Drum's
            entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
            Here he comes. </p>
